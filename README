of64 - openframeworks for 64 bit mac
====================================

Here is a version of oF 007 with all the i386 dependencies removed, and some of the static libraries
recompiled for 64 bit. No Cairo, no Quicktime, although you can use ofxQTKitVideoGrabber and 
ofxQTKitVideoPlayer in lieu.

There is a very crude example of a (Lion compatible) screensaver in there too.

Note:
When distributing screensavers, you need to change the name of the classes to make it unique in the 
list of screensavers - that means changing the names of every instance of MyOpenGLView and
ofxScreensaverView - just do a multi-file search and replace. Change them to any name you like.
